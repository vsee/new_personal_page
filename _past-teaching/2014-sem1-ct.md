This course describes the phases of a modern programming language compiler with
an emphasis on widely-used techniques. The course project will require students
to implement a complete compiler from scratch for a simple programming
language, targeting a real machine assembly such as MIPS. Students will also
learn about implementing a compiler pass in a real compiler framework.
