The new year is starting soon and many courses, including my own are still in need
of teaching support. I need **tutors**, **demonstrators** and a **teaching assistant** for my
second semester course [Inf1-OOP]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/2017-sem2-inf1OP).

If you have good knowledge of Java and a fair idea of object oriented programming, please
apply for one of the positions. You can find all teaching support vacancies here (dice login):
