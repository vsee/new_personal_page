The new year is starting soon and many courses, including my own are still in need
of teaching support. I need **tutors**, **demonstrators**, **markers** and **teaching assistants** for the
second semester course [Inf1-OOP]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/inf1OP),
the postgraduate first semester course [Extreme Computing]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/exc) and
the full year undergraduate [Programming Club]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/pgclub).

The application process in a nutshell:

1. Fill in Teaching Support Applicant Information Form
2. Make an appointment with Informatics Teaching Organisation (ITO) and have your ID checked
3. Fill in Teaching Support Application for Work Form
4. Get in touch with me for a chat about the open positions
