Paul Baecke, Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft down near London will be coming up for a guest lecture at the Extreme Computing course. It is on the coming Monday the 6th of November at 5pm in lecture theatre 4 Appleton Tower.

Paul works in the area of big data, parallel and distributed processing and data visualization. He will be talking about building a high availability, low-latency global service that powers autocompletion across multiple end-points.

Please come along to the lecture, if you are interested in the talk. If you would like to meet Paul for a chat, let me know, and we should be able to arrange something before the lecture.

You can find the Extreme Computing lecture schedule on the [course page](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/lectures.html).

There are more guest talks coming up later in the semester
