During my time as a postgraduate research student I thought I had a busy calendar. After starting my job as a full fledged academic though I quickly noticed that this time was calm compared to being actively involved in the teaching activities of the school. The hardest part for me was to keep track of all the little organisational things that needed to be done while multitasking between different courses and activities.

David Allen's method of [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done) is one of my favourites when it comes to organising my daily todos. I am applying this method for a few years now and it helps me a lot to get my calendar, todos and emails under control. It gives everything a place to go and I can quickly determine what needs to be done next without having to carry it all in my head. I actually manage to completely empty my email inbox every other day.
