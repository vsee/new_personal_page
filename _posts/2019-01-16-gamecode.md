If you are into gamified coding, here are three great resources for you to enjoy:

* [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/) - If you are a beginner programmer or simply love gamified programming.
* [Codin Game](https://www.codingame.com/start) - More gamified coding with some quite challenging problems even involving deep learning tasks. Supports a whole range of languages.
* [CheckiO](https://py.checkio.org/) - Even more gamified coding practice in Python and JavaScript.

We have licences for Code Combat at the [Programming Club](http://progclub.inf.ed.ac.uk/)!
