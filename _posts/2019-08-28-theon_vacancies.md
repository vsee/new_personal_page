The new year is starting soon and many courses, including my own are still in need
of teaching support. I need **tutors**, **demonstrators** and **markers**.

## Open Positions

### Informatics 1 - Object Oriented Programming

There are various posts around Java programming such as **demonstrators**, **tutors** and **markers** for the first year, second semester course [Inf1B]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/inf1OP) formerly known as Inf1-OP. 

The Inf1B course is a 20 credit version of the previous Inf1-OP course. Some changes in the way it is taught will be introduced but the syllabus will stay mostly the same. The Labs will have some new material and tutorials will be held in larger groups with multiple tutors. There won't be an exam and markers are required for handling the assignments at the end of the semester.

### Programming Club

Another area where I am looking for help with is the [Programming Club]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/pgclub). Like in previous years, we offer a selection of interesting programming projects for students to work on for additional programming experience. We aim to offer special sessions such as Interview Training and Coding Competitions and, of course, we have a large box of toys ranging from Lego EV3s, Ardurinos and Raspberry Pi boards to drones and 3D printers. We aim to have something interesting for everyone who shows up no matter if beginner or advanced programmer. 

We need **demonstrators** to provide support during the sessions. Positions are available in first and second semester.

### Extreme Computing

Lastly, we are in need of markers for the fourth year, first semester [Extreme Computing]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/exc) course. We need a few more **assignment markers**. We can only accept post graduate students as assignment markers.
