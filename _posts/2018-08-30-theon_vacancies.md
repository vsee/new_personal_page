The new year is starting soon and many courses, including my own are still in need
of teaching support. I need **tutors**, **demonstrators** and **markers**.

## Open Positions

There are various posts around Java programming such as **demonstrators**, **tutors** and **markers** for the first year course [Inf1-OOP]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/inf1OP).

There will be an introductory branch for Java programming as part of the [INF1A]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/inf1A) course in the first semester of the first year. This branch will be three weeks long during the last three weeks of the semester and cover basics regarding imperative programming in Java. It is aimed to lift beginner programmers to give them a better start for the INF1-OP in the second semester. For this branch I also need **tutors**.

Another area where I am looking for help with is the [Programming Club]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/pgclub). This year we will have a whole bunch of toys ranging from Lego, Ardurinos and Raspberry Pi boards to drones and 3D printers. Additionally, we will have some online course licenses for beginners such as Code Combat and some programming competition stuff for advanced coders. We aim to have something interesting for everyone who shows up no matter if beginner or advanced programmer. We need **demonstrators** to provide support during the sessions.

Lastly, we are in need of markers for the fourth year [Extreme Computing]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/exc) course. We need **assignment markers** and **exam markers**.
