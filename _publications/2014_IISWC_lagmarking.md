# Abstract

Mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablets have become 
tightly integrated with many people's life, both at work and at 
home. Users spend large amounts of time interacting with their 
mobile device and demand an excellent user experience in terms of 
responsiveness, whilst simultaneously expecting a long battery life 
between charging cycles. Frequency governors, responsible for 
increasing or decreasing the Cpu clock frequency depending on the 
current workload and external events, try to balance the two 
contrasting goals of high performance and low energy consumption. 
However, despite their critical role in providing energy efficiency 
it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of frequency governors 
in an interactive environment. In this paper we develop a novel 
methodology for creating repeatable, fully automated, realistic, 
workloads that can accurately measure time lag in interactive 
applications resulting from non-optimally selected operating 
frequencies. We also introduce a new metric capturing the user 
experience for different Android frequency governors. We evaluate 
interactive workloads to demonstrate how our approach enables us to 
automatically record and replay sequences of user interactions for 
different system configurations. We demonstrate that none of the 
available Android frequency governors performs particularly well, 
but leave substantial room for improvement. We show that energy 
savings of up to 27% are possible, whilst delivering a user 
experience that is better than that provided by the standard Android 
frequency governor. We also show that it is possible to save 47% 
energy with performance that is indistinguishable from permanently 
running the Cpu at the highest frequency.
