I am a Research Associate with the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).

I am currently working as researcher as part of the **Institute for Computing Systems Architecture** (ICSA) with [Bj&ouml;rn Franke](https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/bfranke/) and 
[Hugh Leather](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hleather/).

# Research Interests

I am interested in computer systems such as operating systems and compilers
and how machine learning techniques can be used to optimize them.
Specifically, I have worked on:

* energy efficient mobile computing
* scheduling for heterogeneous systems
* compiler optimization
