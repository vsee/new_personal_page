I am an AI scientist at Meta AI research in Menlo Park, California.  

Originally from Berlin in Germany, I was a research graduate student and later teaching staff and research associate at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. As part of the **Institute for Computing Systems Architecture** (ICSA) I did systems research with [Bj&ouml;rn Franke](https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/bfranke/), [Hugh Leather](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hleather/) and many others.

# Research Interests

My research interests are in the field of systems optimization, especially in using machine learning techniques to optimize operating systems and compilers. These are a few things I have been working on:

* Large Language Models to optimize code compilation
* Autotuning of compilers
* Energy efficient scheduling of kernels for heterogeneous systems
* Optimizing energy efficiency of interactive mobile workloads
* Fast instruction set simulation
