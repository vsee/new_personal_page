# Research Interests

I am interested in **mobile and embedded computing**, particularly
in making mobile solutions more energy efficient. My focus lies
on finding software solutions to save energy consumption whilst
keeping the quality of experience for end users high. In so doing
I am looking into the areas of both embedded programming and human
computer interaction. I like to think that machine learning
approaches and heterogeneous processing have high potential of
bringing the research forward in these areas.

In my role as University Teacher I am also interested in exploring
which teaching tools and methods can optimally help students understand
the concepts of computer science.
