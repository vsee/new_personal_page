I am a University Teacher in the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) 
at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).

# Research Interests

I am interested in mobile and embedded computing, particularly
in making mobile solutions more energy efficient. My focus lies
on finding software solutions to save energy consumption whilst
keeping the quality of experience for end users high. In so doing
I am looking into the areas of both embedded programming and human
computer interaction. I like to think that machine learning 
approaches and heterogeneous processing have high potential of 
bringing the research forward in these areas.
