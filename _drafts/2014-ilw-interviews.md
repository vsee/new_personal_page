Most IT industry jobs these days require applicants to participate in a
programming test during the interview phase. These tests can be extensive and
span several hours or even days. The setting is usually somewhat artificial and
requires writing code on a whiteboard while interviewers are scrutinizing every
move. This seminar is designed to provide students with the soft skills
required for performing well in a programming interview. Among them are how to
approach a problem, how to communicate your thought process and how to answer
questions intelligently. The leading talk is followed by a practical session
where students can try out what they learned and receive immediate feedback.
